# Knoxville: Marble City

**Welcome to Knoxville: Marble City**, the heart of the valley and the queen city of the mountains. Established in 2023 as part of the **One World By Night (OWbN)** network, our chronicle offers an immersive live-action role-playing experience set in the **World of Darkness** universe.

## About Our Chronicle

Knoxville: Marble City stands as the newest jewel in the Sabbat Empire. Against the odds, it has been seized from a nascent Camarilla and the forces of the Changing Breeds – now we just have to hold it... 

Our game primarily operates online via our Discord server, with occasional live events to enrich the experience. We host full sessions every third Saturday of the month and facilitate downtime events to keep the narrative engaging.

## Our Mission

We are dedicated to creating a fun, welcoming community of gamers. Our guiding principles include: 

- **Inclusivity**: Welcoming players of all backgrounds and experience levels.
- **Engagement**: Encouraging active participation and collaboration in storytelling.
- **Respect**: Upholding a positive environment free from negativity and drama. [oai_citation_attribution:5‡owbnknoxville.net](https://owbnknoxville.net/home/game-info/)

We follow **Wheaton’s Law**: "Don't be a dick."
