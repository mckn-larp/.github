# Marble City: Knoxville

**Welcome to Marble City: Knoxville (MCKN)**, the heart of the valley and the queen city of the mountains. Established in **2025** as part of the **One World By Night (OWbN)** network, our satelite chronicle offers an immersive live-action role-playing experience set in the **World of Darkness** universe.

## About Our Chronicle

**Marble City: Knoxville** stands as the newest jewel in the Sabbat Empire. Against the odds, it has been seized from a nascent Camarilla and the forces of the Changing Breeds – now we just have to hold it...

Our game primarily operates online via our Discord server, with occasional live events to enrich the experience. We host full sessions every **third Saturday of the month** and facilitate downtime events to keep the narrative engaging.

## Our Mission

We are dedicated to creating a fun, welcoming community of gamers. Our guiding principles include:

- **Inclusivity**: Welcoming players of all backgrounds and experience levels.
- **Engagement**: Encouraging active participation and collaboration in storytelling.
- **Respect**: Upholding a positive environment free from negativity and drama.

We follow **Wheaton’s Law**: _"Don't be a dick."_

## Game Details

- **Setting**: Modern nights in Knoxville, Tennessee.
- **Genres in Play**: Inter-Genre, including various factions and supernatural elements.
- **Ruleset**: White Wolf’s Mind’s Eye Theatre.

> While multiple genres are in play, we do not actively support cross-genre engagement.  
> Our focus remains on delivering immersive and cohesive narratives within each genre.

**Q:** Why the Queen logo everywhere?  
**A:** Knoxville is historically known as *Queen City of the Mountains* due to it's hub in the Appalachians.
