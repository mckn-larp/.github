# Knoxville: Marble City

**Welcome to Knoxville: Marble City**, the heart of the valley and the queen city of the mountains. Established in **2025** as part of the **One World By Night (OWbN)** network, our chronicle offers an immersive live-action role-playing experience set in the **World of Darkness** universe.

## About Our Chronicle

**Knoxville: Marble City** stands as the newest jewel in the Sabbat Empire. Against the odds, it has been seized from a nascent Camarilla and the forces of the Changing Breeds – now we just have to hold it...

Our game primarily operates online via our Discord server, with occasional live events to enrich the experience. We host full sessions every **third Saturday of the month** and facilitate downtime events to keep the narrative engaging.

- **Respect**: Upholding a positive environment free from negativity and drama.

We follow **Wheaton’s Law**: _"Don't be a dick."_
